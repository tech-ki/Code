            A compiler translates a program from one language to another. <br><br>If we want to
write a program in a highlevel language and run it on processor ABC, we can
use a compiler to translate our highlevel program to an equivalent program using
the instruction set of processor ABC. <br>Each highlevel statement will usually
translate to several processor ABC instructions. <br><br>Figure 1.2 shows this process.
To run the same program on processor XYZ we would need another compiler
that translates from the highlevel language to the instruction set of processor
XYZ. The highlevel program is called the source code, and the translated
program is called the executable code or the binary code (reflecting its use of the
binary number system to represent operators and operands). Implementations of
the C and C++ languages usually use compilers to produce executable code for
specific processors.

Compilers are indispensable tools for program developers, but end users have
no desire to use them. A player of a game wants a program that will runâ€”an
executable program. The vendor of that game must provide executable versions
of the game for each processor.

 <span class="one">Interpreters</span> <br>
An interpreter is a program that executes the code rather than translating it to
another language. <br><br>For example, an interpreter would execute the statement
by finding the values of <span class="item">sd</span>baseSalary and bonus, adding them, and storing the
result in totalSalary. <br><br>In this example, the interpreter executes a highlevel
language statement. <br><br>The BASIC language, used on early personal computers that
had insufficient memory to support the compilation process, was typically
implemented by an interpreter.
