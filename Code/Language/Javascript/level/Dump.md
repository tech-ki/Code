## Brush teeth
- Goal: brush teeth more often (3 times a day)
  - Error: I don't like it
    - Why? It feels uncomfortable, the toothpaste is yucky and boring.
    - Try: Let's look up other toothpastes
      - Result: I like the strawberry foam toothpaste.
    - Try: Let's look up other toothbrushes
      - Result: I love the U Shaped one that vibrates and it looks pretty.
  - Review:
    - I needed to try another tyoe of toothbrush and toothpaste. Goal met.
